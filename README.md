PostAddinCommand
================

Test programmatic posting of an external command 
defined by a custom Revit add-in.

There are two types of external commands: 

- external tool commands, listed in the add-in manifest 
and launched by selecting the entry added by Revit in 
the Add-Ins > External Tools menu.

- button commands launched by clicking a custom button
created by an external application.

Both can be lauched programmatically using differnt 
command name strings extracted from the journal file
after manually launching them.
